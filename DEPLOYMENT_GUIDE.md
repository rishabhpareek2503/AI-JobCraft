# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed

1. ✅ **Hardcoded localhost URLs** - Changed from `http://localhost:5000` to relative paths `/api/`
2. ✅ **Missing export** - Added `export default app` to `backend/server.js`
3. ✅ **Next.js directives** - Removed `"use client"` from React components
4. ✅ **Error handling** - Added proper error handling and user feedback
5. ✅ **API validation** - Added input validation and API key checks

## Steps to Deploy

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment issues"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Vercel Environment Variables
Make sure you have set these in your Vercel dashboard:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your valid OpenAI API key

### 3. Test the Deployment
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Check the deployment logs for any errors
3. Visit your deployed app
4. Use the "API Test Panel" to verify the backend is working

## Debugging Steps

### If API is still not working:

1. **Check Vercel Function Logs**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Functions
   - Check the logs for `/api/health` and `/api/suggest-skills`

2. **Test the Health Endpoint**:
   - Visit: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/health`
   - Should return: `{"status":"ok","message":"JD Assistant API is running","hasApiKey":true}`

3. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly
   - Make sure it's available in Production, Preview, and Development

4. **Verify API Key**:
   - Your API key should start with `sk-`
   - Make sure it has sufficient credits
   - Test it in OpenAI's playground

## Common Issues

### Issue: "OpenAI API key is not configured"
**Solution**: Check your Vercel environment variables

### Issue: "OpenAI quota exceeded"
**Solution**: Add credits to your OpenAI account

### Issue: "Invalid OpenAI API key"
**Solution**: Generate a new API key from OpenAI

### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution**: The CORS is now configured to allow all origins for simplicity

## Testing

Use the API Test Panel (temporarily added) to:
1. Test the health endpoint
2. Test the suggest skills endpoint
3. Check if your API key is working

## Remove Test Component

After confirming everything works, remove the test component:
1. Delete `frontend/src/components/ApiTest.js`
2. Remove the import and usage from `App.js`

## Final Checklist

- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Vercel deployment successful
- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] Health endpoint working
- [ ] Suggest skills working
- [ ] Generate JD working
- [ ] Test component removed (optional)

## Support

If you're still having issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Check Vercel function logs
3. Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
